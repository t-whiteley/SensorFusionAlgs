my library of efforts for sensor fusion.

build my knowledge from ground up using least squares, recursive least squares, kalman filter and finally the non linear extended kalman filter.

my goal is to use these in a self-implemented AHRS framework which is currently in the works. I will combine this with my graphical engine to output a dashboard of smooth spacial representation.
